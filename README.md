# exp_work project

A project in which I build experimental functions that might be useful.

It is built using IntelliJ and the newest version of the IntelliJ Haskell plugin by Rik van der Kleij.

So far these include the following modules:

- module Quicksort with my own barebone implementation of Quicksort
- module ListFucs with:
  - a get function to get the n-th element from a list
  - an append function for appending lists in a cleaner and more elegant way than the ++ function

...with more to come as I can think of functions I'd want to use!
