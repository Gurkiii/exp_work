# The exp_work project

A project in which I build experimental functions that might be useful or are just fun to code.

It is built using IntelliJ IDEA by JetBrains and the IntelliJ Haskell plugin by Rik van der Kleij.

# Modules included:

- `module Quicksort` with my own implementation of the Quicksort algorithm
- `module ListFuncs` with:
  - a `get` function to get the n-th element from a list
  - an `append` function for appending lists in a cleaner and more elegant way than the `++` function
- `module TreeFuncs` with
  - a data structure `ContentTree` with content of any type in each `Node` and `Leaf`
  - a `cutTree` function similar to the `take` function for lists for cutting a `ContentTree` structure at a specific height

...with more to come!
